                thereof.</p>

                will furnish Eaton with a signed certification verifying that the Software is being used in accordance
                with the provisions of this Agreement. Eaton may audit Licensee's use of the Software. Any such
                audit will be conducted during regular business hours at Licensee's facilities and will not
                unreasonably
                interfere with Licensee's business activities.</p>

                terminates
                if Licensee breaches any provision of this Agreement. Eaton may terminate this license at any
                time with or without cause.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>3.2 Effect of Termination. </strong>Immediately upon termination of this Agreement or the

                computers and will either return to Eaton or destroy the Software, Documentation, packaging and
                all copies thereof. If Licensee elects to destroy the Software, then Licensee will certify in
                writing to Eaton the destruction of the Software. Termination of this Agreement and return or
                destruction of the Software will not limit either party from pursuing other remedies available
                to it, including injunctive relief. The parties' rights and obligations under the following sections
                of this Agreement will survive termination of this Agreement: Article 1.0, Section 2.1, Section

                <strong>4.1 Infringement. </strong>If Licensee learns of a threat, demand, allegation, or indication
                that the Software infringes or misappropriates any third party intellectual property rights (including
                but not limited to any patent, copyright, trademark, trade dress, or trade secret) ("Intellectual
                Property Claim"), Licensee will notify Eaton promptly of such claim. Eaton may, in its sole discretion,
                elect to assume sole control of the defense and settlement of said Intellectual Property Claim
                and Licensee will provide reasonable information and assistance to Eaton for the defense of such
                claim.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>4.2 Disclaimer of Warranties. </strong>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
                KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF CONDITION,
                UNINTERRUPTED USE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR
                NON-INFRINGEMENT.
                EATON DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE OR SECURE FROM UNAUTHORIZED
                ACCESS. THE LICENSEE EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE
                INSTALLATION AND USE OF THE SOFTWARE IS AT LICENSEE’S SOLE RISK.</p>

                of the Software or components thereof.</p>

            <p>

                COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSS; (B) ANY LOSS OR

                WILL APPLY WHETHER OR NOT EATON HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY
                OF ANY SUCH LOSSES ARISING.</p>

                FOR ANY CLAIMS UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT
                PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE.</p>

            <p>THIS SECTION 5.2 STATES EATON'S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND LICENSEE'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY UNDER THIS
                AGREEMENT, AND IS SUBJECT TO ALL LIMITATIONS STATED IN SECTION 4.2.</p>

                <strong>5.5 Waiver. </strong>The waiver by either party of any default or breach of this Agreement will

                <strong>5.6 Entire Agreement. </strong>This Agreement constitutes the complete agreement between the
                parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations, written or
                oral, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be modified or
                amended except in a writing specifically referencing this Agreement and signed by a duly authorized
                representative of each party. No other act, document, usage or custom will be deemed to amend
                or modify this Agreement. The Software, or portions thereof, may also be subject to additional
                paper or electronic license agreements. In such cases, the terms of this Agreement will be supplemental
                to those in the additional agreements, to the extent not inconsistent with the additional agreements.
                If a copy of this Agreement in a language other than English is included with the Software or
                Documentation, it is included for convenience and the English language version of this Agreement
                will control.</p>

                and regulations of the United States and all other countries in the world (the "Export Laws")
                to assure that neither the Software nor any direct product thereof are (I) exported, directly
                or indirectly, in violation of Export Laws; or (ii) are intended to be used for any purposes
                prohibited by the Export Laws. Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee will not export or re-export
                the Software: (i) to any country to which the U.S. has embargoed or restricted the export of
                goods or services (see http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Pages/Programs.aspx),
                or to any national of any such country, wherever located, who intends to transmit or transport
                the Software back to such country; (ii) to any end user who Licensee knows or has reason to know
                will utilize the Software in the design, development or production of nuclear, chemical or biological
                weapons; or (iii) to any end-user who has been prohibited from participating in U.S. export
                transactions
                by any federal agency of the U.S. government.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>5.9 U.S. Government Restricted Rights. </strong>The Software is a "commercial item" as that
                term
                is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial
                computer software documentation", as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. § 12.212, and is provided
                to the U.S. Government only as a commercial end item. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. § 12.212 and
                48 C.F.R. §§ 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, all U.S. Government End Users acquire the Software
                with only those rights set forth herein. Contractor/manufacturer is Eaton Corporation, 1000 Eaton
                Boulevard, Cleveland, Ohio 44122.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>5.10 Third Party Intellectual Property Rights. </strong>The Software may contain components
                (including
                open source software components) that are owned by third parties ("Third Party Licensors") and
                are provided with, incorporated into, or embedded in, the Software pursuant to license arrangements
                between Eaton and such third parties. Third Party Licensor components in the Software are not
                licensed or warranted under the terms of this document, but are instead subject to the Third
                Party Licensors’ license agreements. Licensee will not modify, delete, or obfuscate any copyright
                or other proprietary rights notices of Third Party Licensors contained in the Software.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>5.11 Indemnity. </strong>Licensee shall defend, indemnify and hold Eaton and its officers,
                directors,
                employees, and agents harmless from and against all losses, damages, liabilities, claims, actions,
                and associated costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) by reason
                of injury or death to any person or damage to any tangible or intangible property arising or
                resulting from the negligence or willful misconduct of the Licensee, its employees, contractors,
                or agents, in connection with Licensee’s use of Software and Documentation.</p>

            <p>Licensee shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its officers, directors, employees,
                contractors, or agents. Licensee shall defend, indemnify, and hold Eaton and its officers, directors,
                employees, and agents harmless from and against any and all losses, damages, liabilities, claims,
                actions, and associated costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses)
                arising out of or in connection with any breach of this Agreement.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>5.12 Confidentiality. </strong>Licensee acknowledges that confidential aspects of the Software
                (including any proprietary source code) are a trade secret of Eaton, the disclosure of which
                would cause substantial harm to Eaton that could not be remedied by the payment of damages alone.
                Accordingly, Eaton will be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive and other equitable
                relief for any breach of this Section 5.12.</p>

            <p>
                <strong>5.13 Note on JAVA Support. </strong>The Software may contain support for programs written in
                JAVA. JAVA technology is not fault tolerant and is not designed, manufactured, or intended for
                use or resale as online control equipment in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance,
                such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communications systems,
                air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons systems, in which the failure of
                JAVA technology could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental
                damage. EATON DISCLAIMS ALL DAMAGES INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES RELATING
                TO THE FAILURE OF ANY SOFTWARE INCLUDING JAVA PROGRAMS AND/OR JAVA TECHNOLOGY.</p>

            <p>

                to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts of the State of Ohio for any action to
                enforce or construe the terms of this Agreement.</p>
