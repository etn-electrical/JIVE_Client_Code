/**
    Implementation of C11 API for platforms that do not have it.

    In contrast to the Memset(3) function, calls to memset_s() will never be
    "optimised away" by a compiler.  This property is required by the follow-
    ing sentences in section K.3.7.4.1 of ISO/IEC 9899:2011 ("ISO C11"):
        Unlike Memset(), any call to the memset_s() function shall be  evalu-
        ated  strictly  according  to  the  rules  of the abstract machine as
        described in (5.1.2.3).  That is, any call to the memset_s() function
        shall  assume  that the memory indicated by s and n may be accessible
        in the future and thus must contain the values indicated by c.

    On Mac OS X, this api is natively implemented.
    On Windows, this api is mapped to SecureZeroMemory()
